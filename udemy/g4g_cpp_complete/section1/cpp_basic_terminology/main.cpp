Basic Programming Terminology:

    ▪ Keywords (reserved words)
        ▪ for
        ▪ while
        ▪ true
        ▪ false
        ▪ if
        ▪ else
        ▪ etc

    ▪ Variables (user defined)
        ▪ used to store and access values
        ▪ x = 5

    ▪ functions
        ▪ a sequence of instructions that do a specific task
        ▪ c = max(a,b)
        ▪ printf("geeks4geeks")
        ▪ can be user defined or built-in

    ▪ Object Oriented Programming
        ▪ class: a type or blueprint like Student, Teacher, etc
        ▪ object: instance of a class (something built from the blueprint)
        ▪ Its really just a way of organizing the program when it gets very large, many will start to
          to use classes and objects
    ▪ Cpp supporst  both types of programming
        ▪ functional or procedural
        ▪ oop

    ▪ Statically Typed
        ▪ C++, Java, etc
        ▪ Faster, but every variable needs to be declared
        ▪ int x; x = 5;

    ▪ Dynamically Typed
        ▪ Python, PHP, Ruby, etc
        ▪ No need to declare variables before using, but slower
        ▪ x = 5  or x = "geeks"

    ▪ Headers Files - since everything needs to be declared before using
        ▪ store declarations of variables, functions, classes, structs, etc.
        ▪ #include <iostream> - for basic input output
            ▪ Typically shouldn't include function definitions. 

    ▪ namespaces
        ▪ divide code into different logical groups to avoid name collisions
        ▪ std - contains standard library functions and types
