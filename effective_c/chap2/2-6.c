/**
 * Storage Duration:
 * There are altogether 4 storage durations available:
 *  - automatic
 *  - static
 *  - thread 
 *  - allocated
 * 
 * Objects of automatic storage duration are declared within a block
 * or as a function parameter. The lifetime of these objects begins when
 * the block in which they're declared begins execution, and ends when
 * execution of the block ends. If the block is entered recursively, a 
 * new object is created each time, each with its own storage. This is why
 * recursion impacts space complexity quickly.
 * 
 * NOTE: ***Scope and lifetime are entirely different concepts. Scope applies
 * to identifiers, whereas lifetime applies to actual objects. The scope of an
 * identifier is the code region where the object denoted by the identifier can
 * be accessed by its name. The lifetime of the object is the time period for
 * which the object exists. ***
 * 
 * 1. Objects delcared in file scope have static duration. The lifetime of these
 *    objects is the entire execution of the program, and their stored value
 *    is initialized prior to program startup. -- We can use the storage-class
 *    specifier 'static' to declare a variable in block scope to have static duration
 *

    // its last-stored value for the life of the program. Static objects must be
    // initialized with a constant value and not a var.
