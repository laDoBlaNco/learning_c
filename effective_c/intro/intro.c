/**
 * The popularity of C can most likely be attributed to several tenets of
 * the language referred to as the SPIRIT OF C
 * 
 *  - Trust the programmer. Generally speaking, the C language assumes you
 *    know what you're doing and lets you. This isn't always a good thing
 *    (for example, if you don't know what you're doing)
 * 
 *  - Don't prevent the programmer from doing what needs to be done. Because
 *    C is a system programming language, it has to be able to handle a variety
 *    of low-level tasks
 * 
 *  - Keep the language small and simple. The language is designed to be fairly
 *    close to the hardware and to have a small footprint
 * 
 *  - Provide only one way to do an operation. Also known as CONSERVATION OF 
 *    MECHANISM, the C language tries to limit the introduction of duplicate
 *    mechanisms.
 * 
 *  - Make it fast, even if it isn't guaranteed to be portable. Allowing you to 
 *    write optimally efficient code is the top priority. The responsibility of
 *    ensuring that code is portable, safe, and secure is delegated to you, the
 *    programmer.
