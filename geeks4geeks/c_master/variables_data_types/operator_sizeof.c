/** Operator sizeof() in C
 * 
 * In C, sizes of different primitive data types can vary depending
 * on the compiler. If I want to know the size of a particular data
 * type on my compiler, C provides the 'sizeof' operator to determine
 * it. It returns the memory required by given variable, data type, 
 * or literals in bytes. The type of the result is 'size_t' which
 * I think of as a generic size type that will fit the largest possible
 * result I would get back.

    // The professor says I'll get into the details of this notation of
    // literals later, but in essence literal notation means we can put
    // the type after the number so above is LL=long long and f = float, If
    // I remove 'f', then the assumed size of literal decimals are double.
    // so 13.6f = 4bytes while 13.6 = 8bytes
