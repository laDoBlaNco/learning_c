     * Literals in C
     * 
     * In C literals are the constant values that are assigned to the
     * variables. They represent fixed values whose meaning does not
     * change during program execution. For example, 'float x = 3.14' 
     * is an expression and the value 3.14 is referred to as an integer
     * literal. 
     * 
     * There are 4 types of literals in C corresponding to the different
     * data types in C: 
     * 
     *  1. Integer Literals
     *     Integer literals are used to represent and store the integer
     *     values only. it an have prefix and suffix that indicates
     *     different properties of the literal. 
     * 
     *      Integer Literals with Prefix
     *      The prefix of the integer literal indicates the base on which
     *      it is to be read: 
     *      ðŸ”¹ No prefix: Decimal value (e.g. 20)
     *      ðŸ”¹ 0x or 0X: Hexidecimal value (e.g. 0x1A)
     *      ðŸ”¹ 0: Octal value (e.g. 016)
     *      ðŸ”¹ 0b or 0B: Binary value (GCC extension, not part of the 
     *         standard, e.g. 0b11)
