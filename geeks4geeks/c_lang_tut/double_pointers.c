/** C - Pointer to Pointer (Double Pointers)
 * 
 * In C, double pointers are those pointers which store the address
 * of another pointer. The first pointer is used to store the address
 * of a variable and the second pointer is used to store the address
 * of the first pointer.  That is why they are also known as
 * pointer to pointers
 * 
 * Syntax of a Double Pointer:
 * The syntax to use double pointers can be divided in 3 parts: 
 *  1. Declaration: 
 *     A double pointer can be declared similar to a single pointer
 *     The difference is we have to place an additional '*' before
 *     the name of the pointer
 *      ‚ñ´Ô∏è type **name;
 * 
 *     Above is the declaration of the double pointer with some name
 *     to the given type. 
 * 
 *  2. Initialization: 
 *     The double  pointer stores the address of another pointer to 
 *     the SAME type. 
 *      ‚ñ´Ô∏è name = &single_ptr;     // After declaration we don't use **name if
 *                                // we've already declared type **name;
 *      ‚ñ´Ô∏è type **name = &single_ptr;  // With the declaration altogether
 * 
 *  3. Dereferencing: 
 *     To access the value pointed to by the double pointer, we have to
 *     use the dereference operator * two times (once to get to the first
 *     pointer and second to get to the first pointer's value)
 *      ‚ñ´Ô∏è *name;   // Gives you the address of the single pointer
 *      ‚ñ´Ô∏è **name;  // Gives you the value of the variable it points to
 *

 * 
 * In C, a double pointer behaves similarly to a normal pointer. So,
 * So the SIZE OF THE DOUBLE-POINTER variable is always equal to the
 * normal pointers i.e. only depending on the operating system and 
 * CPU arch. 
 *      ‚ñ´Ô∏è 8 bytes for 64-bit 
 *      ‚ñ´Ô∏è 4 bytes for 32-bit
 * 
 * Examples of Double Pointers:

/**
 * Application of Double Pointers in C
 * 
 * Following are the main uses of pointer to pointers in C
 *  ‚ñ´Ô∏è They are used in the dynamic memory allocation of multidimensional
 *    arrays
 *  ‚ñ´Ô∏è They can be used to store multilevel data such as the text document
 *    paragraph, sentences, and word semantics
 *  ‚ñ´Ô∏è They are used in data structures to directly manipulate the address
 *    of the nodes without copying
 *  ‚ñ´Ô∏è They can be used as function arguments to manipulate the address 
 *    stored in the local pointer
 * 
 * Multilevel Pointers in C
 * Double pointers are not the only multilevel pointers supported by 
 * the C language. What if I want to change the value of a double pointer?
 * In this case, I can use a triple pointer, which will be a pointer 
 * to a pointer to a pointer i.e., ***t_ptr.
 *  ‚ñ´Ô∏è int ***ptr3;
 *  ‚ñ´Ô∏è int ****ptr4; 
 *  ‚ñ´Ô∏è ... etc
 * 
 * Similarly to change the value of a triple pointer I can use a
 * pointer to a pointer to a pointer to a pointer (4 level pointer).
 * In other words, I can say that to change the value of a "level -- x" 
 * variable I can use a "level -- x+1" pointer. 
 * 
 * BE CAREFUL WITH THE NUMBER OF LEVELS
