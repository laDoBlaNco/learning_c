/**Void Pointers
 * 
 * So I've already learned about 'void' with regards to functions,
 * it literally means 'nothing' in C. Its used in a few different
 * contexts: 
 *      ‚ñ´Ô∏è void update_soldier(soldier_t *s); means the function 
 *        returns nothing
 *      ‚ñ´Ô∏è soldier_t new_soldier(void); means the function takes no
 *        arguments
 * 
 * And, because C likes re-using ideas but with slightly different
 * meanings (the genius of the design can't be understood by us mere
 * mortals) void also has another use!
 * 
 * A void* 'void pointer' tells the compiler that this pointer could
 * point to ANYTHING This is why void pointers are also known as a
 * GENERIC POINTER. Since void pointers do not have a specific data
 * type, they can't be directly dereferenced or used in pointer 
 * arithmetic without casting them to another pointer type first. 
 * 
 * Casting to Void Pointers
 * Casting to and from void pointers in C is unique because void 
 * pointers are type-agnostic. When casting a specific type pointer
 * to a void pointer, no type information is retained, allowing the
 * void pointer to point to any data type. Howerver I MUST cast a
 * void pointer back ot its original type before dereferencing it,
 * as direct dereferencing is not possible. 
 * 
 * A common pattern is to store generic data in one variable, and 
 * the type of that data in another variable. This is useful when
 * I need to pass data around without knowing its type  at compile
 * time. Which is kinda what malloc is doing for example. 
 * 
 * Assignment: 
 * Complete the snek_zero_out function. It accepts a generic pinter
 * one of: 
 *      ‚ñ´Ô∏è snek_int_t
 *      ‚ñ´Ô∏è snek_float_t
 *      ‚ñ´Ô∏è snek_bool_t
