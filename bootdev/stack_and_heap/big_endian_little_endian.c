/**Big Endian and Little Endian
 * 
 * While we are on the topic of memory, it's worth knowing about 
 * "endianness". Endianness is the order in which bytes are stored
 * in memory. The two most common formats are big endian and little 
 * endian. 
 * 
 * Big Endian: 
 * In a big-endian system, the most significant byte is stored first
 * at the lowest memory address. The "most significant byte" is just
 * a fancy way of saying "the biggest part of the number". 
 * 
 * Let's say I have the hexadecimal number 0x12345678. Here's how
 * it would be stored in big-endian format:

 * 
 * The most significant byte (0x12) is stored at the lowest memory
 * address
 * 
 * Little Endian
 * In little-endian system, the least significant byte ("the smallest"
 * part of the number) is stored first, at the lowest memory address. 
 * This is the format used by most modern computers. 
 * 
 * Using the same number 0x12345678, hee's how it would be stored
 * in little-endian format: 
 * https://storage.googleapis.com/qvault-webapp-dynamic-assets/course_assets/ZSZ1rxc.png
 * 
 * Hee the least significant byte (0x78) is stored first
 * 
 * For the most part, I won't have to worry about endianness when
 * writing programs. The way data is read from memory automatically
 * handles this, so I can spend my valuable time building e-commerce
 * shops for the terminal instead. Endianness becomes important in 
 * certain scenarios, like networking and working with binary files. 
 * 
 * For now, just know that most modern systems use little-endian, and
 * the compiler takes care of how data is stored and accessed.
