/**The Stack
 * 
 * Remember how memory is basically just a giant array of bytes
 * with address at different offsets?
 * 
 * While that's true there are also some additional structure. The
 * memory is devided into two may regions:
 *      ðŸ”¹ stack
 *      ðŸ”¹ heap
 * 
 * The stack is where local variables are stored. When a function
 * is called a new STACK FRAME is created in memory to store the
 * function's parameters and local variables. When the function
 * returns, its entire stack frame is deallocated or popped off the
 * stack. 
 * 
 * The stack is aptly named: it is a stack (LIFO) data structure
 * of memory frames. Each time a function is called a new frame
 * is pushed onto the stack, including 'main'. When a function 
 * returns, its frame is popped off the stack. 
 * 
 * For example:
 * with the function below if I call 'create_typist(1)', before the
 * call, the stack memory might look like this: 
 * https://storage.googleapis.com/qvault-webapp-dynamic-assets/course_assets/Ir7pLV9.png
 * 
 * An array of contiguous memory with its addresses every 4 bytes. 
 * Once called, the STACK POINTER is moved to make room for: 
 *      ðŸ”¹ The return address (to pick up execution after the function
 *         returns)
 *      ðŸ”¹ Arguments to the function
 *      ðŸ”¹ Local variables in the function body
 * https://storage.googleapis.com/qvault-webapp-dynamic-assets/course_assets/dA4uooG.png
 * 
 * the local variables are stored in the stack frame: 
 * https://storage.googleapis.com/qvault-webapp-dynamic-assets/course_assets/hVO0TxY.png
 * 
 * When the function returns, the stack frame is deallocated by resetting the
 * stack pointer to where the frame begins.
 * 
 * Assignment: 
 *      1. Run the code in its current state
 *      2. Update 'where' print_message_two and print_message_three 
 *         are called from so that all three of the functions use
 *         the same stack space
