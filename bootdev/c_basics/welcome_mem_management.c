/**
 * Understanding how my software runs on hardware is super important
 * for writing fast, performant code. Its like I learned with Go, 
 * you have to understand the hardward to really know what your program
 * is doing. In this course Ill be walking through all about one of the
 * main aspects of software performance. Memory management using C 
 * as a guide.
 * 
 * Goals of the course:
 * 1. Understand how and where programs store data in memory. Variables
 *    functions and objects don't get to exist for free. Where do they
 *    live as your code runs?
 * 2. Learn how to make programs more efficient. Most performance related
 *    problems in backend software are memory related (at least in my 
 *    experience). Learn how it all works so you can troubleshoot and 
 *    optimize.
 * 3. Practice programming in a lower-level language. C gets yo much 
 *    closer to the hardware than Python, JavaScript, or Go. By writing
 *    C, I'll learn a lot about how software works closer to the metal.
 * 4. Learn about Garbage Collection (and build my own). I'll likely
 *    continue to work with GC languages where its python, Go, JS, etc.
 *    Best to understand what trade-offs are being made. 
 * 
 * NOTE: This isn't a C course, though I'm taking it in conjunction with
 * a couple of C courses. Here I'm writing C code and covering the basics
 * of C that I'll need, but in focus of memory management and not C 
 * specifically.
