/**Helper Fields
 * 
 * One interesting (albeit not commonly used) trick is to use unions
 * to create "helpers" for accessing different parts of a piece of
 * memory. 
 * 
 * for example, below in memory we would have a union that will hold
 * memory for uint32 but that would actual hold the value of an RGBA
 * of size 32bits or a struct of 4 fields 8bits each. 
 * https://storage.googleapis.com/qvault-webapp-dynamic-assets/course_assets/su7cGjT.png
 * 
 * Only 4 bytes are used, and unlike in 99% of scenarios, it actually 
 * makes sense to both set and get values from this union through both 
 * the components and rgba fields. Both fields in the union are 
 * EXACTLY 32bits in size meaning that we can 'safely?' access the 
 * entire set of colors through the .rgba field or get a single 
 * color component through the .components field
 * 
 * The convenience of additional fields, with the efficiency of a
 * single memory location!
 * 
 * Assignment: 
 * Complete the PacketHeaer union that will have 2 potential fields
 *      ðŸ”¹ tcp_header: A struct. The first 2 bytes being src_port. 
 *         the next 2 bytes are dest_port, and the last 4 bytes 
 *         are seq_num
 *      ðŸ”¹ raw: An array of 8 bytes
 * Use uint8_t, uint16_t, and uint32_t for the types of the fields
 * based on the number of bytes needed. 
 *      ðŸ”¹ 8 bits = 1 byte
