// so I'm basically saying that this type can hold either an int
// or a char*, but not both at the same time. Its either or. For
// both at the same time I would do the exact same but as a struct.
// I provide the list of possibilities so the C compiler knows the
// max potential memory requirement, and can account for that, being
// that my possible types won't be the same size. Then I can use it
// like this:
int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
    age_or_name_t lane = {.age = 29};
    printf("Age: %d\n",lane.age); // so an obvious question is what 
    // do I use (%d) if the type is a char* and not an it? Is there
    // a generic formatter?

    // Here where it gets interesting, as if it wasn't already ðŸ¤”, What
    // happens when I try to to access the name field (even though I set
    // the age field)? 
    // printf("name: %s\n",lane.name); // seg fault????

    // we get nothing? Or better yet we get undefined behavior which is
    // the root of vulnerabilities and hacks. A union only reserves enough
    // space to hold the largest  type in our union and then all of the
    // fields use that same memory. So when I set .age = 29, I'm writing
    // the integer rep of 29 to the memory of lane union, even though
    // it way more memory than needed. If I try to access .name, I read
    // from the same block of memory but but interpreting the bytes as
    // char *, which is why I get garbage resulting in a seg fault.
    // Simply put, setting a value of .age overwrites the value of .name
    // and vice versa, so I should only access the field I set, which again
    // makes this potentially dangerous.
