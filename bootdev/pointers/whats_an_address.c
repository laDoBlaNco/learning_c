/**Whats an Address
 * 
 * So I saw in the last lesson that memory can be thought of as a
 * big array of bytes, and each byte has an address.
 * 
 * That's true, and the beauty is that each address is LITERALLY
 * JUST A NUMBER. It's not some fancy code, just a number. So why
 * do they look like 0xfff8?  That's hex!
 *      1. Its written in hexadecimal (base 16) instead of decimal
 *         (base  10)
 *      2. It's a pretty big number, so its not very human readable.
 *         0xfff8 is 65,528 in decimal.
