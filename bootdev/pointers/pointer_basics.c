/**Pointer Basics
 * 
 * Again Pointers are just variables with an address as its value
 * that tells the computer where to look for OTHRE VALUES. just like
 * how the address to my house is not actually my house, but POINTS
 * to my house
 * 
 * Syntax/Semantics Review:
 * We declare a pointer using the pointer type declaration which is
 * any type declaration with an *:
 * int *pointer_to_something; // declares 'pointer_to_something' as a
 * pointer-to-int
 * 
 * Get the address of a variable, thus creating the pointer you are 
 * going to put into the pointer variable with &
 *      int meaning_of_life = 42;
 *      int *pointer_to_mol = &meaning_of_life;
 * pointer_to_mol now holds address to meaning_of_life
 * 
 * Dereferencing Pointers:
 * A lot of times I'll want to get access to the data that my pointer
 * is pointing to, not just the address itself, but the value stored 
 * at that address. Well then I use the * again, but without the 
 * type name, to dereference or access the value of that pointer. Its
 * simply the pointer is REFERENCING a value so now with *, I'm 
 * DEREFERENCING that reference to get the value back. And just get
 * the value but TOUCHING THE ACTUAL VALUE IN MEMORY. 
 * 
 * It can get a bit confusing, but I just have to remember that the
 * * does two different things. 
 *      1. Declaring a pointer type: int *pointer_to_thing;
 *      2. Dereferencing a pointer value: *pointer_to_thing = 20 or
 *         int my_value = *pointer_to_thing;
 *

    // struct pointing to that first field. But I still have my
    // questions below

// someting feels off. I'm getting the value from the pointer here,

// what I need and then look at that value from anywhere else in
// the program and see the changes??? Not return a new copy of it.

// But when I look at the original its not changed. so even with the 
// pointer we are getting the value, updating and returning it, but
// not changing it inline, so to speak. That's a bit strange from
// what I understood as to how pointers should work. I'll come back to
// this note later???
