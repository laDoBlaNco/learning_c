/**Pointer Size
 * 
 * So the size of an array depends on both the number of elements
 * and teh size of each element. And since an array is just a
 * pointer, it makes me think about what size is the pointer? Though
 *  in reality the name of the array is only pointing to the first
 * element, so does it really matter?  Sorry I'm digressing
 * 
 * An array is a contiguous block of memory where each element has
 * a specific size. 
 * 
 * In C, pointers are always the same size becasue they just rep
 * memory addresses. The size of a pointer is determined by the arch
 * of teh system (32 or 64 bit). A pointer's size doesn't depend on
 * the type of data ti points to. True, I was think it about the
 * size of the first element but not even that matters since a ptr
 * value is the address itself therefore the pointer size is just
 * that address. It just holds the address of a memory location.
 * 
 * for example the first set below is all the same size becasue
 * I have a 64 bit system, no matter how much memory the value at
 * that address takes up.
 * 
 * so what about an array? So the arrays are different so they do
 * depend on something other than just the address size that the
 * arch determines ðŸ¤”.
 * 
 * The array type keeps track of the size of each element and the
 * number of elements. Although an array is a pointer to the first
 * element, IT'S NOT JUST A POINTER. IT'S A BLOCK OF MEMORY THAT
 * HOLDS ALL THE ELEMENTS. So even though the identifer points to
 * the address location of the first element, it still holds all
 * the elements meaning that the size does depend on what its 
 * holding. 
 * 
 * So om my system a pointer is 8 bits, but an array will be the 
 * size of an element * the number of elements. That's why
 *      - int_array = 4 bytes * 10 = 40
 *      - char_array = 1 byte * 10 = 10
 *      - double_array = 8 bytes * 10 = 80
 *
