/**Sizeof Enum
 * 
 * The same sizeof operator that we've talked about works on 
 * enums.
 * 
 * Generally, enums in C are the same size as the int. However
 * if an enum value exceeds the range of an int (which as I learned
 * is the limit of 1 word size 4 or 8 bytes), the C compiler will
 * use a larger integer type to accommodate the value, such as an
 * unsigned int or a long
 * 
 *      ðŸ”¹ unsigned int doesn't represent negative numbers, so it
 *         can represent larger positive numbers.
 *      ðŸ”¹ long is just a larger integer type than int, so it can
 *         represent larger numbers. 
 * 
 * Just Fancy Integers
 * Enums are often used to represent the possibilities in a set. 
 * For example: 
 *      ðŸ”¹ SMALL = 0
 *      ðŸ”¹ MEDIUM = 1
 *      ðŸ”¹ LARGE = 2
 *      ðŸ”¹ EXTRA_LARGE = 3
 * 
 * The program proabably cares a lot abot which size a variable 
 * represents, but it probably doesn't care that SMALL happens to
 * be 0 under the hood. From the compiler's perspective, enums
 * are just fancy integers. 
 * 
 * Assignment
 * At the start of main(), print the size of the two enums defined
 * in main.c:
