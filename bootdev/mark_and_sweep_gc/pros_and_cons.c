/**Pros and Cons
 * 
 * To solve the cyclic reference issue (and to force myself to 
 * implement another GC algorithm ü§î) I'm going to implement a 
 * Mark and Sweep GC
 * 
 * Pros of Mark and Sweep: 
 *      ‚ñ´Ô∏è Can detect cycles, and thus prevent memory leaks in certain
 *        cases
 *      ‚ñ´Ô∏è Less on-demand book keeping (Remember all work done by GC is
 *        'wasted' - it doesn't make our custom AI product any faster)
 *      ‚ñ´Ô∏è Reduces potential performance degradation in highly multi-
 *        threaded programs (refcounting requires atomic updates for
 *        thread safety)
 * 
 * Cons of Mark and Sweep: 
 *      ‚ñ´Ô∏è More complex to implement (here we go)
 *      ‚ñ´Ô∏è Can cause 'stop-the-world' pauses when lots of objects exist
 *        and must be freed (resulting in poor performance) This happens
 *        with Go
 *      ‚ñ´Ô∏è Higher memory overhead
 *      ‚ñ´Ô∏è Less predictable performance
 * 
 * So after including all the boiler plate below I have vm_t which is
 * a kinda virtual machine that will simulate what would normally 
 * be happening if sneklang were a real thing. Its a simplified 
 * version since I'm only concerned with the gc aspects. 
 * 
 * If I look at the vm header stuff below I see that vm_t has a field
 * *frames which holds a stack of frames, which are pushed and popped
 * as I enter and exit new scopes. At each scope entrance ( in this case
 * function calls) a new stack frame is pushed onto the frames stack.
 * When we exit a scope (function return), I pop the stack frame off
 * the frames stack. Since we are using void* to work with generics
 * in C, I can't actually tell what the data type held by the stack_t
 * is for each field. I'll have to write some wrapper functions later
 * to help me make sure that I don't accidentally push the wrong 
 * kinds of data into the stack (yay C!). Haters!
 * 
 * The objects field is also a stack, but it holds snek_object_t pointers
 * 
 * in VM STUFF below I need to complete the vm_new function and the
 * vm_free functions.
