/** Multiple Types
 * 
 * So I know see that I can push both int and int* types into my stack
 * (again, horrible idea). 
 * 
 * In this example, I'll see that not only can I push values and pointers
 * onto the same stack, but I can also push different types of values into
 * the same stack. 
 * 
 * This is once again a terrible idea, but the thrust of what I'm getting at
 * here is: 
 *      ‚ñ´Ô∏è C DOESN'T CARE WHAT I PUT IN MEMORY, IT'S BYTES ALL THE WAY DOWN
 * 
 * Fortunately, C doesn't let me do these types of conversions automatically,
 * which means I have to be doing this deliberately and explicitly, so one 
 * would think I know what I'm doing by going this route ... 
 * 
 * But C will still let me do it. When I'm working with void*, I'm working
 * with raw memory addresses, and I can cast them to anything I want.
