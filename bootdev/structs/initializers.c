/**Initializers
 * 
 * So how do I go about actually making a struct n C? I've seen how
 * to create the type, but the actual struct. Well there are a 
 * few ways to do it and dpeending on the situation I'll have to
 * use the best one.
 * 
 * Let's create a struct type below and then initialize it in 
 * different ways:
